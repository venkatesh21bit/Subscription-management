# Wireframe vs Frontend Implementation Analysis

## Wireframe Overview

From the uploaded wireframe images, I can identify **8 key pages** designed for a subscription/e-commerce management system:

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HOME Page** | Landing page with navigation (Company Logo, Home, Shop, My Account, Cart, My Profile) |
| **Shop Page** | Product listing with Category filter, Price Range filter, Search, Sort by Price, and product grid |
| **Product Page** | Detailed product view with image gallery, product details, variants selection, quantity, Add to Cart |
| **Cart Page** | Multi-step checkout with Order/Address/Payment tabs, cart summary, taxes, discount codes, checkout |
| **User Details Page** | Editable profile with User Name, Email, Phone Number, Address fields |
| **Orders Page** | Order history table with Order ID, Order Date, Total columns |
| **Order Detail Page** | Individual order view with Order/S0001/Inv/001, Payment button, Download button, Renew option |
| **Order Confirmation** | "Thanks for your order" page with order number and payment confirmation |
